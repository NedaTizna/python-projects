# Simple Calculator 

This project was created as part of my learning journey in Python programming.  
It's one of several mini-projects designed to demonstrate basic Python skills.

- Addition ➕  
- Subtraction ➖  
- Multiplication ✖️  
- Division ➗  

# How It Works

The program asks the user to enter:

1. The first number  
2. The operator (+, -, *, or /)  
3. The second number  

It then performs the calculation and displays the result.
